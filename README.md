# NTiCD
This repository is the implementation of the paper: "Neural Time-Invariant Causal Discovery from Time Series Data".
### Overview
* ./singleseq: contains the codes for experiments with single-sequence synthetic data, including a sample data and data-generation code 
* ./multiseq: contains the codes for experiments with multi-sequence synthetic data, including sample data and data-generation code
* ./realData: contains the codes for experiments with Netsim data, including data and data-preparation code
### Usage
To reproduce the experiments, get into the corresponding directory and run following commands:
* bash run_singleseq.sh
* bash run_multiseq.sh
* bash run_netsim.sh
